Hey there! Welcome to logec attack!

Blah Blah how to use

Shells:

First off, the inital shell offered by a client connecting to the host is (intentionally) very limited, as it is meant to fly under the radar.
It uses python's subprocess to run system commands, and as such, tools like cat, nano, or anything requiring input does not work. If you want a 
full interactive shell, click on Target -> Spawn Shell and choose what ever shell you would like - however this will probably set off some alarms
